                                A quantiative view of rating movies and acting. Giving scores to some aspects in the movie,
                                basicaly the ones who are considered in the Oscars such as cinematography, music, screenplay ,etc.

                                To rate actors is kind of different it is measured in a specific way it is possible to capture and for instance
                                give a precise score to the acting. A lot comes from the idea of being more strict if the actor has more
                                time on screen.

                            <li>Every review at the end of the day is just my opinion but i will try to empathize with every perspective
                                so i can give a more precised review without lacking of details and not abusing of generality.
                            </li>

                                The scores for acting and movies also will come from my opinion. But at least for acting there will be some calculus 
                                behind to give a precise score. Obviously i will accept discuss of the calculus behind if some don't agree.
